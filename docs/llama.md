# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“– LLAMA-16 Wiki ðŸ“–ðŸ¦™

Welcome to the LLAMA-16 wiki! These docs are here to help you on your journey of exploring microarchitectures with your favorite camelid. Here you will find information on writing programs with the LLAMA-16 instruction set, tips on how to debug programs and machine behavior, and some sample programs used to demonstrate some of the features of this project.

## What is LLAMA-16?

LLAMA-16 is a 16-bit microarchitecture designed with simplicity in mind. It is an attempt to scale back the colossal complexity of x86_64 assembly into something that is a little more digestible and palatable format. You can find a summary of the project in the [README](../README.md). 

## How do I write programs for LLAMA-16?

You can find a reference of the instruction set here: [LLAMA-16 ISA](./isa.md).

Once you've crafted your 100% bug free code on the first try, you can reference the [LLAMA-16 Assembler](./assembler.md) documentation to assemble you code.

When you've got your binary saved, learn how to run it in the [LLAMA-16 Emulator](./emulator.md).

## Can't find what you are looking for?

Organizing a project like this can be a slow and monumental task for one lowly mortal undergrad developer so there might be some gaps in the docs. Worry not my assembly blueberries! Feel free to open an issue and tag it with the **Documentation Request/Error** label. Want to contribute to the project by drafting the docs? Open a Merge Request with your changes/drafts and lets talk about them!

## Want to contribute?

Thank you so much for wanting to be a part of this project! If you think of a feature you'd like to see or find a bug when using this software please feel free to get your hands dirty in the source code of this project and figure out how it works. When you're satisfied with your progress, open a Merge Request with your changes and get that conversation started!
